  "description": "<p>Puppet technology helps you know what's in your infrastructure, and how it's configured across all the physical components of your data center; your virtualized and cloud infrastructure; and everything you're running in containers. Puppet automatically keeps everything in its desired state, enforcing consistency and keeping you compliant, while giving you complete control to make changes as your business needs evolve.</p><p><b>Please Note - </b>This deployment will go through a number of steps. Firstly, the Ubuntu Server 16.04-LTS virtual machine will be deployed. Towards the end of the deployment, a <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmcspirit/azurestack/master/scripts/install_puppet.sh' target='_blank'>custom bash script</a> will be executed which will install the latest stable Puppet platform components, along with some initial configuration of the Puppet environment based on data entered at deployment time</p><p>Once you have completed the deployment, view the Outputs in the deployment blade to access the Puppet Master Server FQDN and virtual machine admin account, which you can use to SSH to the virtual machine.</p><p>For more information, and to continue learning about Puppet, review the links below.</p>",
