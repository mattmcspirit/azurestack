  "description": "<p>Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.</p><p>Ansible’s main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use. It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, featuring a minimum of moving parts, usage of OpenSSH for transport (with an accelerated socket mode and pull modes as alternatives), and a language that is designed around auditability by humans–even those not familiar with the program.</p><p>We believe simplicity is relevant to all sizes of environments, so we design for busy users of all types: developers, sysadmins, release engineers, IT managers, and everyone in between. Ansible is appropriate for managing all environments, from small setups with a handful of instances to enterprise environments with many thousands of instances</p><p>Ansible manages machines in an agent-less manner. There is never a question of how to upgrade remote daemons or the problem of not being able to manage systems because daemons are uninstalled. Because OpenSSH is one of the most peer-reviewed open source components, security exposure is greatly reduced. Ansible is decentralized - it relies on your existing OS credentials to control access to remote machines. If needed, Ansible can easily connect with Kerberos, LDAP, and other centralized authentication management systems</p><p><b>Please Note - </b>This deployment will go through a number of steps. Firstly, the Ubuntu Server 16.04-LTS virtual machine will be deployed. Towards the end of the deployment, a <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmcspirit/azurestack/master/scripts/install_ansible.sh' target='_blank'>custom bash script</a> will be executed which will install the latest stable Ansible release, along with performing the initial configuration of the environment based on data entered at deployment time</p><p>Once you have completed the deployment, view the Outputs in the deployment blade to access the Ansible FQDN and virtual machine admin account, which you can use to SSH to the virtual machine.</p><p>For more information, and to continue learning about Ansible, review the links below.</p>",
