  "description": "<p>The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.</p><p>This template will install the latest stable Jenkins version on a Linux (Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS) VM and will allow you to get started learning and understanding key Jenkins tasks.</p><p><b>Please Note</b> - The deployment will go through a number of steps. Firstly, the Ubuntu Server 16.04-LTS virtual machine will be deployed. Towards the end of the deployment, a <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmcspirit/azurestack/master/scripts/install_jenkins.sh' target='_blank'>custom bash script</a> will be executed which will install the Jenkins Master, based on the data you provide during deployment.</p><p>Once you have completed the deployment, view the Outputs in the deployment blade to access the Jenkins Master FQDN. Open this link in a browser. You'll be prompted for a security token, which you can obtain by establishing an SSH session to the Jenkins Master VM, then running <b>sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword</b>. Copy and paste this token into the form in your browser to continue the Jenkins Master setup.</p><p>For more information, review the links below.</p>",
