  "description": "<p>Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.</p><p>Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter. Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the described infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental execution plans which can be applied.</p><p>The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc.</p><p><b>Please Note - </b>This deployment will go through a number of steps. Firstly, the Ubuntu Server 16.04-LTS virtual machine will be deployed. Towards the end of the deployment, a <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmcspirit/azurestack/master/scripts/install_terraform.sh' target='_blank'>custom bash script</a> will be executed which will install the latest stable Terraform release, along with performing the initial configuration of the environment based on data entered at deployment time</p><p>Once you have completed the deployment, view the Outputs in the deployment blade to access the Terraform Server FQDN and virtual machine admin account, which you can use to SSH to the virtual machine.</p><p>For more information, and to continue learning about Terraform, review the links below.</p>",
