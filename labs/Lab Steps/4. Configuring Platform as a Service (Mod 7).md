Module 7: Platform as a Service and Microsoft Azure Stack

Lab: Configuring Platform as a Service in Azure Stack
-----------------------------------------------------

Scenario

The SQL and MySQL Resource Providers have been installed in the Azure Stack
environment but have not been configured with hosting servers. Additionally,
Plans and Offers have not been configured for either SQL or MySQL databases. You
need to ensure that tenants can provision databases in Azure Stack by
configuring the hosting servers that will be used to host these databases. You
must also ensure that resources for both SQL and MySQL are not overprovisioned
by configuring Quotas. You must test that databases can be provisioned
successfully using the Azure Stack Portal. One of Contoso’s customers has a
company intranet that they want to host in Azure Stack. You must configure App
Service in Azure Stack to facilitate this.

Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Add hosting servers to the SQL and MySQL resource providers.

-   Configure a Plan and Offer for the SQL and MySQL resource providers.

-   Provision a SQL and MySQL databases using the Azure Stack Portal.

-   Provision websites using App Service.

Lab Setup

**Estimated Time:** 75 minutes

**Host Computer** AZS-RDP01

**User Name:** AzureStack\\CloudAdminX

**Password:** Pa55w.rd

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Add hosting servers to the SQL and MySQL resource providers.

-   Configure a Plan and Offer for the SQL and MySQL resource providers.

-   Provision a SQL and MySQL databases using the Azure Stack Portal.

-   Provision websites using App Service.

### Exercise 1: Adding hosting servers

Scenario

Before tenants can provision databases in Azure Stack the SQL and MySQL resource
providers must be connected to a hosting server. This is the actual SQL instance
that will be used to host provisioned databases in Azure Stack. You must add a
hosting server to both the SQL and MySQL resource providers.

**NOTE:** This Exercise can only be performed once. It is advised that the
instructor performs this exercise while the students review.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Add a hosting server to the SQL resource provider
