Module 6: Infrastructure as a Service and Microsoft Azure Stack

Lab: Provisioning Storage and Virtual Machines in Microsoft Azure Stack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario

After creating some basic offers and plans, Contoso Ltd. wants to allow another
user to evaluate the Azure Stack Development Kit. The user is familiar with
Azure but not the Azure Stack Development Kit. Contoso wants to create some
storage accounts and a virtual network and provision virtual machines. They also
want to test how connectivity into the virtual machines can be achieved. In
order to monitor the Azure Stack environment effectively, Contoso also want to
deploy System Center 2016 Operations Manager. You have been provided with the
relevant ARM Templates to deploy an AD DS Domain Controller and an Operations
Manager Management Group. You must use these templates to deploy the monitoring
environment.

Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create resource groups by using the Azure Stack Portal.

-   Create storage accounts by using the Azure Stack Portal and ARM templates.

-   Create virtual networks and subnets by using the Azure Stack Portal and ARM
    templates.

-   User ARM templates to deploy System Center 2016 Operations Manager.
