|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Computer | **AzS-RDP01**                                     |
| Tool     | **Internet Explorer**                             |
| URL      | **https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external** |

    in the blade that opens

4.  Close the **Azure Stack Portal**.

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have created a new Marketplace item
for Contoso’s StockCheck application. You should have also published the
Marketplace item in Azure Stack. Finally, you should have confirmed that tenants
can select the new Marketplace item when they sign into the Azure Stack Portal.

>   **Question**: You have created a plan and offer in the Azure Stack Portal
>   for tenants to subscribe to. When a tenant opens the Azure Stack Portal and
>   attempts to get a new subscription, the new offer is not displayed. What
>   could be the reason for this?
