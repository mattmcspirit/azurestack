# What is Azure Stack?

Microsoft Azure Stack is a new hybrid cloud platform product that enables you to deliver Azure services from your own datacenter.

Azure Stack gives you the power of cloud services, yet enables IT to maintain control of your datacenter for true hybrid cloud agility. You decide where to keep your data and applications—in your own datacenter or with a hosting service provider. Easily access public cloud resources to scale at busy times, for dev-test, or whenever you need them.

## Deliver Azure services to your datacenter

Azure Stack enabled you to transform on-premises datacenter resources into cloud services for maximum agility. Run Azure IaaS services—including Virtual Machines, Blob/Table storage, and Docker-integrated Linux containers—for applications like SQL Server or SharePoint. Empower developers to write cloud-first applications using on-premises deployments of Azure PaaS services such as App Service. Make your application counterparts productive by enabling the same self-service experience as Azure.

You can learn more about Azure Stack on the dedicated [Azure Stack website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/) and see some cool videos on the [Azure Stack Channel on Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/azurestack)

It's also a great platform to learn about DevOps, and what better way to learn about DevOps, than through utilizing the DevOps Toolkit.
