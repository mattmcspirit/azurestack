# Azure Stack Scripts
In this folder, you'll find each of the respective scripts that are executed when an ARM template is deployed within Azure Stack.  The scripts are called automatically from their respective ARM templates.

## Troubleshooting & Improvements
The scripts contained within this folder have been developed and tested, to the best of my ability.  I'm not a specialist in Linux scripting, thus, if you do encounter issues, [let me know through GitHub](<../../../issues>) and I'll do my best to resolve them.

Likewise, if you are awesome at PowerShell, or Linux scripting, or would like to have additional tools included within the packages, let me know, and we can collaborate to improve the overall project!
